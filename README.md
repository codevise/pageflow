For a high level introduction and example Pageflow stories see
[pageflow.io](http://pageflow.io).

In addition to this README, there is also a [Getting Started Wiki page](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/wiki/Getting-Started)
to guide you through the steps of setting up a Rails application with Pageflow 
on your development machine.

## Updating

For instructions on how to update from a prior version of the gem see
the
[Updating Pageflow](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/wiki/Updating-Pageflow)
wiki page.

## Ingredients

Pageflow is a Rails engine which roughly consists of the following
components:

* A full MVC stack to manage and display Pageflow stories
* User and permission management with support for isolated accounts
  and user collaboration
* A client side application for live preview editing of stories
* Background jobs to process and encode images, audios and videos
* Generators to quickly bootstrap a new Rails application

Pageflow assumes the following choice of libraries:

* [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for authentication
* [CanCan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan) for authorization
* [ActiveAdmin](http://activeadmin.info/) for administration
* [Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) for background jobs
* [FriendlyId](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id) for pretty URLs
* [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) for attachment handling
* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/) for client side development


## Requirements

Pageflow runs in environments with:

* Ruby >= 1.9.3 and < 2.2.0 because of [ActiveAdmin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/3715)
* Rails 4.0 or 4.1
* Redis server (for Resque)
* A database server supported by Active Record (tested with MySQL)

Accounts of the following cloud services have to be registered:

* [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) for S3 file storage and
  (optionally) Cloudfront content delivery
* [Zencoder](http://zencoder.com) for video/audio encoding

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    # Gemfile
    gem 'pageflow'

At the moment, Pageflow depends on a frozen version of Active Admin
since, back when development started, no Rails 4 compatible version of
Active Admin was available as a gem. You therefore need to bundle the
`rails4` branch that we have forked into our github organization:

    gem 'activeadmin', git: 'https://github.com/codevise/active_admin.git', branch: 'rails4'
    gem 'ransack'
    gem 'inherited_resources', '1.4.1'
    gem 'formtastic', '2.3.0'
    # Only required for Rails 4.1:
    gem 'state_machine', git: 'https://github.com/codevise/state_machine.git'

Run bundler to install dependencies:

    $ bundle install

### Create the database

As the generator needs the presence of a database, you must create it:

    $ rake db:create

### Generate a User model

Pageflow assumes the presence of a `User` model and corresponding `users`
table in the database. If your application doesn't have that, generate it:

    $ rails generate resource user name email encrypted_password

### Running the Generator

Now you can run the generator to setup Pageflow and its dependencies:

    $ rails generate pageflow:install

The generator will invoke Active Admin and Devise generators in turn
and apply some configuration changes. When asked to overwrite the
database seeds, choose yes.

To better understand Pageflow's configuration choices, you can run the
single steps of the `install` generator one by one. See the wiki page
[The Install Generator in Detail](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/wiki/The-Install-Generator-in-Detail)
for more. If you'd rather not look behind the scenes for now, you can
safely read on for now.

## Database Setup

Now it's time to migrate the database.

    $ rake db:migrate

If you do not like Rails' default database choices you might have to
alter your `database.yml` first.

Finally, you can populate the database with some example data, so
things do not look too blank in development mode.

    $ rake db:seed

## Configuration

Pageflow stores files in S3 buckets also in development
mode. Otherwise there's no way to have Zencoder encode them. See the
wiki page [Setting up external services](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/wiki/Setting-up-External-Services).

For available configuration options and examples see the inline docs
in `config/initializers/pageflow.rb` in your generated rails app.

## Running Pageflow

In addition to the Rails server, you need to start two Rake tasks for 
the background job processing. First, start a Resque worker which handles
jobs from all queues:

    $ QUEUE=* rake resque:work
    
Image and video processing are examples of jobs that are executes by these workers.

Some jobs need to be executed repeatedly. For example, while videos are being
encoded by Zencoder, there is a job that runs every few seconds to fetch the 
current progress. This delayed invocation of jobs is handled by the Resque
Scheduler Rake task:

     $ QUEUE=* rake resque:scheduler

Consider using the [foreman gem](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) to start all of
these processes (including the Rails server) with a single command in your 
development environment.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into problems during the installation of Pageflow, please refer to the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/wiki/Troubleshooting) wiki 
page. If that doesn't help, consider [filing an issue](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/issues?state=open).
