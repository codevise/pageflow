## Installation

Pageflow Scrolled is currently distributed as part of the `pageflow`
gem. The following steps assume that Pageflow has been set up already
in the host application. Pageflow Scrolled requires Webpacker to be
installed in the host application. Add Webpacker dependency to your
application's `Gemfile`:

```
gem 'webpacker', '~> 4.2'
```

Run the Webpacker install generator:

```
$ bundle exec rake webpacker:install
```

React is required as a peer dependency of the `pageflow-scrolled`
package:

```
$ yarn add react@^16.13.1 react-dom@^16.13.1
```

Add the following lines to your application's `package.json` file to
depend on the `pageflow` and `pageflow-scrolled` packages which are
distributed as part of the `pageflow` gem:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "bundle exec rake pageflow_scrolled:create_bundle_symlinks_for_yarn"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "pageflow": "file:.bundle/for-yarn/pageflow/package",
    "pageflow-scrolled": "file:.bundle/for-yarn/pageflow/entry_types/scrolled/package",
    ...
  }
}
```

The preinstall script looks for `package.json` dependencies of the
form

```
.bundle/for-yarn/gem-name/package/path
```

and creates a symlink in the Git ignored directory `.bundle/for-yarn`
which points to the location of the gem as reported by `bundle show`.

Run the install generator for Pageflow Scrolled:

```
$ bundle exec rails generate pageflow_scrolled:install
```
