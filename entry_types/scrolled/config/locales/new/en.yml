          # Motif areas

          By specifying a motif area of an image, you can tell
          Pageflow which part of the image is most important. For
          example, for a portrait this could be the face of the
          depicted person.

          When the image is then used as the background of a section,
          Pageflow tries to make sure the reader has an undisturbed view  can actually see this
          part of the image.

          1. If the image cannot be displayed uncropped (e.g. because
             it has landscape format while the entry is being viewed
             on a phone in portrait orientation), the background is
             positioned in a way to center the motif area in the
             available space.

          2. If the section contains text or other content elements,
             empty space is inserted at the beginning of the section
             to make sure the motif area is not covered by other
             content when first reaching the section. The content
             starts intersecting with the motif area only when the
             reader continues scrolling.

             Layout responds intelligently in such cases: If, for
             example, the text of the section is positioned on the
             left such that the motif area of the image can be
             displayed completely on the right, no additional space
             will be inserted at the beginning of the section.

          You can edit the motif area of a background image via the
          "Select motif area" menu item of the "Background image"
          field in the section settings.

            ("Sticky"). Sticky elements remain static in the middle of the viewport alongside the
            text until either the section is scrolled out of the viewport or until they get pushed
            upwards by the next sticky element of the section. On mobile devices sticky elements

              The section background can either display an image, a color or a video loop.
              In case of background images you can specify the main image motif area. This area will

              to be enlarged such that the whole browser window (the so called viewport) is covered.
              Deactivate this option to create a short section. The height of the section and its background
              is then determined only by the content of the section.  Multiple sections with different
              backgrounds can then be visible at once on the user's screen. This option needs to be activated

              section to the current. The different settings have specific effects concerning the

              "Cross-Fade Backgrounds" are only available if the "Use Full Viewport-Height" option
              has been enabled in the settings of both adjacent sections.
