            hyphens:
              inline_help: |
                With manual hyphenation, words are only ever separated
                at positions that have been marked with a soft
                hyphen. This helps prevent separating words at
                unwanted positions. Without soft hyphens, long words
                will be continued to the next line without a hyphen.
                Therefore, always double check mobile display when
                using manual hyphenation.

          # Content Elements

          In each section, any number of content elements can be
          inserted and positioned against a background. The position
          of the content elements on wide screen aspect ratios is
          determined by the foreground **positioning of the section**
          (left, right, center). In portrait mode on smartphones
          (upright) the content elements are always displayed one
          below the other for space reasons.

          To add a new content element, click on the **plus button**
          above or below an existing one and then insert text blocks,
          media, embeds or external links.

          Click on a content element to select it. The sidebar then
          displays options for **positioning the content element** and
          other options, such as activating **autoplay for audio and
          video**.

          For display on wide screen aspect ratios (desktop, notebook,
          tablet, smartphone landscape), individual content elements
          such as videos, audios, video embeds, 360° images can also
          be arranged separately from the text flow as **sticky**
          elements. Sticky elements remain static in the middle of the
          viewport alongside the text until either the section is
          scrolled out of the viewport or they get pushed upwards by
          the next sticky element of the section.

          If a section is aligned centrally, content elements can also
          be **indented to the left or right**. In this case, the
          content element is reduced in size so that the text can be
          displayed next to, instead of below the content element."
      meta_data:

          # Title and Options

          General settings for the entry. Please select a sub item on the left.
      motif_area:
        menu_item: Motif areas
        text: |
          # Motif areas

          By specifying a motif area of an image, you can tell
          Pageflow which part of the image is most important. For
          example, for a portrait this could be the face of the
          depicted person.

          When the image is then used as the background of a section,
          Pageflow tries to make sure the reader has an undisturbed view  can actually see this
          part of the image.

          1. If the image cannot be displayed uncropped (e.g. because
             it has landscape format while the entry is being viewed
             on a phone in portrait orientation), the background is
             positioned in a way to center the motif area in the
             available space.

          2. If the section contains text or other content elements,
             empty space is inserted at the beginning of the section
             to make sure the motif area is not covered by other
             content when first reaching the section. The content
             starts intersecting with the motif area only when the
             reader continues scrolling.

             Layout responds intelligently in such cases: If, for
             example, the text of the section is positioned on the
             left such that the motif area of the image can be
             displayed completely on the right, no additional space
             will be inserted at the beginning of the section.

          You can edit the motif area of a background image via the
          "Select motif area" menu item of the "Background image"
          field in the section settings.
      outline:
        menu_item: Chapter, Sections, Content Elements
        text: "# Chapter, Sections, Content Elements\n\nA Pageflow consists of one or more **chapters**, which\ncan contain several **sections** each. For each section\na background (e.g. a picture or a video loop) can be used\nwhich is displayed while the reader is within the section.\n\nSections contain **content elements**, which\ncan be of different types (e.g. text, images,\nvideos, charts). They build the actual\ncontent of the entry through which the reader scrolls.\n\nTo insert content elements, first click on **\"New\nChapter \"** to create a first chapter. If you click on the\nchapter header, you can specify the title and a description\nthat should appear in the navigation bar.\n\nNext, click **\"New Section \"** to add a section to the chapter. \nIn the preview on the left side a selection rectangle is now shown \naround the new section. In the sidebar you can edit the options \nof the section. Here you can set a picture or a colour as background for the section.\n\nDetails can be found under: [Section Options](#pageflow_scrolled.help_entries.sections)\n\nThe section already contains a text block. Click on the text to edit it.  With a click in the empty area next to the text, you can select the section again.\n\nWhen the section is selected, a plus button with the caption **\"Add new element \"** is displayed below the last element. If you click on it, you can choose what type of content element you want to insert. When a content element is selected by clicking on it, its settings can be edited. For details on the available content elements, see: [Content Elements](#pageflow_scrolled.help_entries.content_elements)\n\nAt the top and bottom of the selection rectangle around a content element there are also plus buttons, which can be used to insert further elements before or after the selected element.."

          # Overview

          This is the editor for editing pageflows. With its split screen it allows direct preview during editing, shows changes to the text or newly selected files immediately and saves them automatically.

          ## Title and options

          Under "Title and options" you can set basic parameters of the appearance, as well as title, language, imprint etc. For this purpose, you can define texts that are to be displayed when sharing the article via social media services.

          Details can be found under: [Title and Options](#pageflow_scrolled.help_entries.meta_data)

          ## Manage files

          Under "Manage files" you upload the media files to be used in the pageflow. You can also reuse already uploaded videos, photos and audios here.

          Details can be found under: [Manage Files](#pageflow.help_entries.files)

          ## Outline

          Via the "Outline" you can add chapters and sections, i.e. edit the actual content. You can also re-sort sections and chapters at any time using drag & drop.

          Details can be found under: [Chapters and Sections](#pageflow_scrolled.help_entries.outline)

          ## Phone Preview

          The switch at the bottom of the sidebar next to the help button can be used to switch to the phone preview. This allows you to test how your entry looks and works in portrait format.
      sections:
        menu_item: Section Options
        text: "# Section Options\n\nA click in an empty area of a section will display a selection rectangle around the section. On the right side of the selection rectangle you will find a button with a pencil icon that allows you to edit the options of the section in the sidebar.\n\n## Layout\n\nThe **Foreground Positioning** option allows you to select how the contents of the section should be arranged horizontally. For example, if the background of the section is on the right side, text and content elements can be positioned on the left side and vice versa. For backgrounds in the total or a centred motif, the content elements can be positioned in the middle.\n\nBy selecting a **gradient function**, a sufficient contrast between text and background can be ensured. With the **shadow**, the background is darkened or lightened with a colour gradient. With the **Card** setting, the content elements are displayed on a surface with rounded corners.\n\n## Background\n\nEither an **image**, a **colour** or a **video loop** can be displayed in the background of the section. For background images and video, the important (to be emphasised, essential) part of the image can be marked. This motif area is then initially not covered by the scrolling foreground in both desktop and mobile device displays. Further information about the \"motif areas\" here.\n\nThe **Background image (portrait)** option can be used to optionally specify an alternative image to be used if the screen aspect ratio of a terminal device is higher than wide, for example on smartphones and tablets in portrait mode. The image can be configured as an alternative to the background image in landscape mode, from which otherwise important parts might be cut off.\n\n## Atmo Audio\n\nWith the **\"Atmo\"**, each section can play sound in the background, regardless of the content element. It can be determined whether a sound can only be heard in one section or continues over several sections without interruption. Simply select the same audio file for the following sections under **Options** as Atmo. In this way chapters can be acoustically separated from each other and coherent pages can be interwoven more strongly.\n\nWhen playing audio and video, you can also select whether the background sound should continue to play normally or more quietly during media playback, or whether it should fade out completely. The setting of the ambience sounds can be accessed on each page via the **Options** tab. If the atmosphere disturbs you while editing your entry in the editor, you can temporarily mute it with the key combination **Alt + a**. To reactivate the Atmo, simply press **Alt + a** again.\n\n\n## Transitions\n\nA **transition effect** can be selected between every two sections. \nClick in the background of a section to select it. On the right side \nof the selection rectangle, buttons with two interlocking arrows as \nsymbols appear at the borders of the neighbouring sections. \n\nClick on one of the buttons to select the transition effect for the section \nborder in the sidebar.\n\nThe **Fade** effect is only available between sections for which the \n**Full Viewport Height** option has been activated.\n"
