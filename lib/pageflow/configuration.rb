    # A constraint used by the pageflow engine to restrict access to

    # Limit the use of certain resources. Any object implementing the

    # Example:
    #
    #     config.quotas.register(:users, UserQuota)
    #

    # Either a lambda or an object with a `match?` method, to restrict
    # access to the editor routes defined by Pageflow.

    # This can be used if published entries shall be available under
    # different CNAMES but the admin and the editor shall only be
    # accessible via one official url.

    # Either a lambda or an object with a `call` method taking two
    # parameters: An `ActiveRecord` scope of {Pageflow::Theming} records
    # and an {ActionDispatch::Request} object. Has to return the scope
    # in which to find themings.
    #
    # Defaults to {CnameThemingRequestScope} which finds themings
    # based on the request subdomain. Can be used to alter the logic
    # of finding a theming whose home_url to redirect to when visiting
    # the public root path.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #     config.theming_request_scope = lambda do |themings, request|
    #       themings.where(id: Pageflow::Account.find_by_name!(request.subdomain).default_theming_id)

    # parameters: An `ActiveRecord` scope of `Pageflow::Entry` records
    # and an `ActionDispatch::Request` object. Has to return the scope
    # in which to find entries.
    #
    # Used by all public actions that display entries to restrict the
    # available entries by hostname or other request attributes.
    #
    # Use {#public_entry_url_options} to make sure urls of published
    # entries conform twith the restrictions.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #     # Only make entries of one account available under <account.name>.example.com
    #     config.public_entry_request_scope = lambda do |entries, request|
    #       entries.includes(:account).where(pageflow_accounts: {name: request.subdomain})

    # Either a lambda or an object with a `call` method taking a
    # {Theming} as paramater and returing a hash of options used to
    # construct the url of a published entry.
    #
    # Can be used to change the host of the url under which entries
    # are available.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #     config.public_entry_url_options = lambda do |theming|
    #       {host: "#{theming.account.name}.example.com"}
