        text: |-
          # Manage Files

          Pageflow processes all major media formats (photo, audio,
          video) and converts them into different formats and
          qualities. The system adapts the quality of the media to the
          internet connection and the end device of the user
          automatically. In principle the files should be uploaded in
          the optimal resolution and not be compressed beforehand. In
          order to have a well-structured work-flow, it is helpful to
          store all audio-files, background-video-loops, movies,
          pictures and texts in the required version in a separate
          file on your computer.

          ## Upload and Manage Files

          The menu item „Manage Files“ leads to the files, which have
          already been uploaded. If you click „Add more“ and „Upload“
          you can add more files.

          After you have uploaded the files, they are processed on the
          server. This can take a few minutes - especially if the
          videos are long. Click on the thumbnail of a file, in order
          to see its status. Moreover you can see the general features
          like the size of the picture or length of an audio-file and
          you can download the original file.

          The files can already be used before the process is
          finished. You can therefore continue your work during the
          loading process.

          ## Reuse Files

          Videos, audio files and pictures can be used in more than
          one article. Thus, videos, for example, do not have to be
          uploaded several times. Click on „Manage Files“ and on
          „Add“/„Reuse“, to search for files in other articles and add
          them to a new one.

          ## Edit File Settings and Copyright

          If you click on the thumbnail of a media file (picture,
          video, audio), you can add information with regards to its
          copyright. This information is shown automatically in the
          legal notice.

            ## Title of the Pageflow

            Here you can choose a title for your Pageflow. It will be
            shown on the title bar of the browser window. It also acts
            as an indicator for search engines once the report is
            published.

            ## Language

            Decide in which language your Pageflow should be displayed. This refers to the frontend text such as multimedia tips, scroll-indicators, the overview and the legal notice.

            ## Credits
            Here you can enter your imprint information in free text. In addition, image rights can be assigned for all files under "Manage files", which are then automatically displayed in the imprint.

            Choose a picture, which should be shown, if your Pageflow is
            shared in social networks.

            ## Summary

            Here you can write a description, which is shown, when your
            Pageflow is shared in social networks.

            ## Social Sharing URL

            If contributions are embedded in your own web pages (with
            a different URL), you can specify an individual URL here
            that is to be used when sharing the contribution.

            ## Social Share Links

            Determine which share buttons should be displayed when
            clicking on the "Share function".

          # Chapters and Pages

          A Pageflow consists of at least one chapter with at least
          one page. You can create as many chapters and pages as you
          want. In order to create content, click:

          1. „New Chapter“ to create a new chapter,
          2. „New Page“ to add a page,
          3. onto the new page, in order to edit the content.

          ## Structuring Chapters

          You can structure the composition of your Pageflow with
          chapters - e.g. thematically or chronologically . The
          chapters are shown in the overview and help the users find
          their way around. It is therefore advisable to give each
          chapter a title.

          If you create an unnamed chapter, Pageflow acts as if there
          is no structure of chapters. The chapter and the title of
          this chapter are consequently not shown in the
          overview/navigation.

An entry can either be published for an unlimited period of time or until a specific deadline.\n\nBesides this, there is the possibility to publish Pageflows with \na password protection. Just activate „Protect with password“. \nPageflow uses the name of the account as user name and \nautomatically generates a password, which can be changed afterwords. \n\nAlready published stories can also be protected with a password by \npublishing another version - the other way round works as well. \nFor this please just click on the „Publishing“ button. The following \nsteps will then be shown and explained within the dialog window.\n\n### Changes After Publishing\nPublished Pageflows can also be depublished manually at any time. If a\nPageflow has already been published, changes will not be\nshown until you publish your report again.  A Pageflow can\nonly be edited by one author at one time.\n\n### Embedding as iframe\nPublished articles can also be embedded in your own website. You can find more information in this [article](https://pageflow.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/11000002744)  \n\n### Embedding iframe Teaser\nThumbnail for embedding the Pageflow on external websites\nAfter publishing your Pageflow, the system generates a\nthumbnail, which can be embedded as an iframe to the\nhyperlink of another website. By means of the code, the size of the iframe can be adjusted. The minimum size is a height 150px and a width of 220px."
      text_tracks:
        menu_item: Text tracks
        text: |-
          # Text tracks

          Text tracks can be added to video and audio files. Open the
          file setting dialog of a video or audio file by clicking the
          files's "Settings" button in the "Manage files" view and
          switch to the "Text tracks" tab.

          Here you can upload SRT or VTT text track files. Each text
          track has a language, kind and label attribute. The label is
          displayed to the user in the subtitles menu on video and
          audio pages.

          If a video or audio file has text tracks, the user can
          choose to activate them on video or audio pages. Please note
          that text tracks will not be displayed when a video plays as
          a loop in the page background or when an audio file is used
          as background atmo.

          ## Automatic subtitles

          The selection made by the user in the subtitles menu on
          video or audio pages is stored between pages and
          sessions.

          By default the option "Auto" is selected in the subtitles
          menu. A text track to display is then choosen automatically
          according to the following rules:


          * If a file has a text track of kind "translation" in the
            language of the story, it is displayed as subtitle
            automatically. This is meant for people who are able to
            understand the language of the story, but not the language
            spoken in the video or audio.

          * If instead the file has a text track of kind "audio
            replacement", it is displayed automatically if the volume
            has been set to mute using the controls in the navigation
            bar. Please note that for technical reasons it is not
            possible to detect if the volume has been set to mute
            outside of the browser or on mobile devices in general.

          ## Default text track

          If the automatic selection described above does not fit your
          needs, you can select a default text track for each video or
          audio page. It will be displayed if the user has not
          selected a text track from the subtitles menu.

          Open the files tab of the page and choose a default text
          track from the conext menu available via the menu button
          inside the video or audio file field.
