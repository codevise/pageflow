            Full-screen image or video loop and text

            By using the page type „Background-Image/Video“, large pictures
            or video loops are the background for the text and are paired with a
            manually adjustable color gradient for an optimal
            legibility. In order to have an optimal presentation on
            mobile devices you can adjust the image detail to the
            display. Optionally the text color can be inverted. This
            is especially useful for bright background-images.

            Users are able to hide the color-gradient and text in
            the front-end, if they want to have a view of the
            background image or video.

          # Atmo Audio

          This feature lets you add background audio to every page regardless of its page type. You can define if a sound should play only for one page or continue playing for more pages without interruption. Simply select the same atmo audio file for some adjacent pages.

          That way chapters can be seperated acoustically and pages that belong together can be weaved to a stronger unit.

          For the page type „Video“ there is a special option to pause background audio or continue at lower volume while the video is playing.

          You find the atmo settings on the „Options“ tab of each page.

          Should you ever feel distracted by the atmo audio while working on your story, you can use the hot key „Alt + a“ to temporarily mute it. Simply press „Alt + a“ again to reactivate atmo audio.

          CAUTION: Atmo audio does not play on mobile devices.

        menu_item: Manage Files
        text: |
          # Manage Files

          Pageflow processes all major media formats (photo, audio,
          video) and converts them into different formats and
          qualities. The system adapts the quality of the media to the
          internet connection and the end device of the user
          automatically. In principle the files should be uploaded in
          the optimal resolution and not be compressed beforehand. In
          order to have a well-structured work-flow, it is helpful to
          store all audio-files, background-video-loops, movies,
          pictures and texts in the required version in a separate
          file on your computer.

          ## Upload and Manage Files

          The menu item „Manage Files“ leads to the files, which have
          already been uploaded. If you click „Add more“ and „Upload“
          you can add more files.

          After you have uploaded the files, they are processed on the
          server. This can take a few minutes - especially if the
          videos are long. Click on the thumbnail of a file, in order
          to see its status. Moreover you can see the general features
          like the size of the picture or length of an audio-file and
          you can download the original file.

          The files can already be used before the process is
          finished. You can therefore continue your work during the
          loading process.

          ## Copyrights of Files

          If you click on the thumbnail of a media file (picture,
          video, audio), you can add information with regards to its
          copyright. This information is shown automatically in the
          legal notice.

          ## Reuse Files

          Videos, audio files and pictures can be used in more than
          one article. Thus, videos, for example, do not have to be
          uploaded several times. Click on „Manage Files“ and on
          „Add“/„Reuse“, to search for files in other articles and add
          them to a new one.

        text: |
          # Title and Options

          ## General

          ### Title of the Pageflow

          Here you can choose a title for your Pageflow. It will be
          shown on the title bar of the browser window. It also acts
          as an indicator for search engines once the report is
          published.

          ### Language

          Decide in which language your Pageflow should be
          displayed. This refers to text which cannot be edited - like
          multimedia tips, scroll-indicators, the overview and the
          legal notice.

          ## Appearance

          ### Multimedia tips before the start

          Decide if tips or advice should be shown at the beginning of
          your Pageflow.

          ### Highlighting chapter beginnings

          This option lets the title of the first page of a chapter
          appear in a bigger font.

          ### Highlighting new pages

          At the beginning of a Pageflow an info-box shows new pages
          that were created since the last visit.

          ### Display Home-Button

          You can have a button in the navigation, which hyperlinks to
          an external website, for example back to the website from
          which you hyperlinked to the Pageflow.

          ### Navigation

          Choose between two forms of navigation: The navigation with
          a progress bar or the navigation with thumbnails. Please
          note, that due to the lack of space on mobile devices only
          the icon „Overview“ is shown.

          ## Social

          ### Social Sharing Picture

          Choose a picture, which should be shown, if your Pageflow is
          shared in social networks.

          ### Summary

          Here you can write a description, which is shown, when your
          Pageflow is shared in social networks.

        text: |-
          # Chapters and Pages

          A Pageflow consists of at least one chapter with at least
          one page. You can create as many chapters and pages as you
          want. In order to create content, click:

          1. „New Chapter“ to create a new chapter,
          2. „New Page“ to add a page,
          3. onto the new page, in order to edit the content.

          ## Structuring Chapters

          You can structure the composition of your Pageflow with
          chapters - e.g. thematically or chronologically . The
          chapters are shown in the overview and help the users find
          their way around. It is therefore advisable to give each
          chapter a title.

          If you create an unnamed chapter, Pageflow acts as if there
          is no structure of chapters. The chapter and the title of
          this chapter are consequently not shown in the
          overview/navigation.
      overview:
        menu_item: Overview
        text: |-
          # Overview

          This is Pageflow’s editing platform. The division of the
          screen into two allows you to edit your Pageflow and see a
          preview at the same time. The editor shows modifications and
          newly selected files directly and saves them automatically.

          The sidebar can be hidden or shown. You can change the size
          of the preview-window by pulling the sidebar to the right or
          the left. If the preview-window is long and narrow like ´ a
          smartphone, you will only be able to see the „overview“ icon
          and not the entire navigation. This is due to lack of space.

          The navigation is divided into four parts:

          ## Title and Options

          Under „Title and Options“ you can set up basic appearance
          parameters as well as the title, language and legal
          notice. You can also decide which content should be
          displayed when sharing the report on social media platforms.

          For more details see: [Title and Options](#pageflow.help_entries.meta_data)

          ## Manage Files

          Under „Manage Files“ you can upload your media files, which
          you want to use in Pageflow. Furthermore you can reuse
          videos, photos and audio-files that have already been
          uploaded.

          For more details see: [Manage Files](#pageflow.help_entries.files)

          ## Outline

          Via the „Outline“ you can add chapters and pages - the
          actual content. Per Drag and Drop you can resort the pages
          and chapters any time.

          For more details see: [Chapter and Pages](#pageflow.help_entries.outline)
      page_options:
        menu_item: General Page Options
        text: "# General Page Options\n\n### Title\n\nHere you can add the title of a particular page. This\ntitle is not only the headline of the text on the page, it\nalso functions as the title in the navigation and\noverview. If a single page is shared in social networks,\nthis title is also the title of the social media post.\n\n### Hide the title\n\nOptionally you can hide the title. Thus the title is not shown as the\nheading of the text body. For the identification of the page it\nremains visible in the navigation, overview and on social media posts.\n\n### Tagline and Subtitle\n\nHere you can optionally enter a tagline and/or a\nsubtitle. If you click on „Hide title“ the tagline and\nsubtitle are not shown either.\n\n### Text\n\nThe text-block can be formatted with the buttons underneath\nthe input field. [B= bold / I=italic / U=underlined /\ninfinity symbol= Link/URL to an external website]\n\nAll changes are visible in the left front-end-view as soon\nas you leave the appropriate input field in the editor.\n\n### Textposition\n\nDecide if the text should be shown on the left or right side.\n\n### Opacity of the gradient\n\nThe opacity of the gradient improves the legibility of\nthe text on background-videos or pictures.\n\nYou can use the slider to darken or lighten up the\nbackground until the contrast between text and background is\noptimal.\n\n### Invert colors\n\nIf you invert the colors, „bright“ and „dark“ are\ninterchanged. Thus the normally white font changes into\nblack.\n\nA general rule: Bright font for dark pictures, dark font for\nbright pictures.\n\n### Thumbnail\n\nThe thumbnail replaces the automatically generated\npreview-picture in the navigation and overview.\n\n### Display in navigation\n\nIf this option is not taken, the particular page is not\nrepresented in the navigation and therefore cannot be\nreached through it.  You can use this option if a page is\nsupposed to read more like a subpage of another page.\n\n### Transition effect\n\nThere are different scroll effects, which are visible when users enter or leave pages. You can use vertical transitions like „crossfade“ or „cut“ or „Fade to black“. Besides this you also can choose horizontal scrolling from right or left. You can determine which effect should be used for each individual page.\n\n### Fade in text after delay\n\nDefine whether text and gradient of a page should appear with a delay. \nUsers will first see the background image, then title, tagline and subtitle until finally the content text will be displayed.\n\nThere are three different durations of delay: short = 1 second, medium = 3 seconds, long = 5 seconds.\n\nThis feature fits best for intros or beginnings of chapters.\n\n### Description for the overview\n\nYou can enter a text, which appears when the user navigates\nwith the mouse over the particular page. This text matches\nwith the mouse-over-text for the page-type „Page References“\nas well as with the text, which appears when you share the\nPageflow in social networks."

          # Page Types

          By choosing the page type, you determine what type of media
          files are used for which page. For each type of page you can
          use different settings.  For further information please
          click on a page type on the left column.
      publishing:
        menu_item: Publishing
        text: "# Publishing\n\nClick on the „Publish“ button to publish your Pageflow. A\nPageflow can be published at any point in time. \n\nBesides this, there is the possibility to publish Pageflows with \na password protection. Just activate „Protect with password“. \nPageflow uses the name of the account as user name and \nautomatically generates a password, which can be changed afterwords. \n\nAlready published stories can also be protected with a password by \npublishing another version - the other way round works as well. \nFor this please just click on the „Publishing“ button. The following \nsteps will then be shown and explained within the dialog window.\n\nPublished\nPageflows can also be depublished manually at any time. If a\nPageflow has already been published, changes will not be\nshown until you publish your report again.  A Pageflow can\nonly be edited by one author at one time.\n\nThumbnail for embedding the Pageflow on external websites\nAfter publishing your Pageflow, the system generates a\nthumbnail, which can be embedded as an iframe to the\nhyperlink of another website. By means of the code, the size\nof the iframe can be adjusted. The minimum size is a height\n150px and a width of 220px."
      storylines:
        menu_item: Storylines
        text: "# Storylines\n\nIn addition to linear narrations from top to bottom, further storylines can be used as non linear excursions to enlarge upon parts of a story. A „Storyline“ consists of chapters and pages, which users scroll through. Distinguishable is the so called main storyline from further subordinate ones. The user starts off in the main storyline and can then navigate to different excursions.\n\nTo create such an excursion from the main storyline use one of the „Link“ pages (Mosaic, Collage, Hotspot) and create the desired connections via „Links“.\n\nBy choosing a „Parent page“ you can determine to which page users return after scrolling the storyline´s last page.\n\nTransitions to subordinate storylines are visually supported by a horizontal animation as the default setting for entering and leaving. \n\nStorylines are created by clicking onto the plus button next to the storyline menu. Thereby a new chapter opens automatically in which further pages can be added. \n\n\n### Parent pages\n\nIn every subordinate  storyline a „Parent page“ must be determined to define where users land when scrolling back.\n\nThis target page can be chosen by clicking on the pen symbol next to the storyline menu. When a „Parent page“ is defined, a back button will be shown automatically in the subordinate storyline that will always lead users back to the „Parent page“.\n\n\n### Chapter hierarchy\n\nThe use of more than one „subordinary“ storylines and the definition of „Parent pages“ leads to a chapter hierarchy as known from books:\n\n1. (Main storyline), 1.1. (Superior sub storyline), 1.1.1. (Subordinate sub storyline) and so on.\n\nThis hierarchy can be edited afterwards by clicking on the pen symbol next to the storyline menu. A subordinate storyline can be turned into the main storyline as well.\n\n\n### Scroll successors\n\nIf you want to lead users from a last page of a subordinate chapter (1.1.1) to another position than\nthe „Parent page“ (e.g. to 2.1) you can define a „Scroll successor“. Therefore click on the blue pen symbol within the storyline settings. As an example the following sequence might be imaginable: 1 -> 1.1 -> 1.1.1 -> 2.1\n\nAttention: While editing only the selected chapter will be shown in the sidebar. To switch to the other chapters click onto the storyline menu."
      text_tracks:
        menu_item: Text tracks
        text: |-
          # Text tracks

          Text tracks can be added to video and audio files. Open the
          file setting dialog of a video or audio file by clicking the
          files's "Settings" button in the "Manage files" view and
          switch to the "Text tracks" tab.

          Here you can upload SRT or VTT text track files. Each text
          track has a language, kind and label attribute. The label is
          displayed to the user in the subtitles menu on video and
          audio pages.

          If a video or audio file has text tracks, the user can
          choose to activate them on video or audio pages. Please note
          that text tracks will not be displayed when a video plays as
          a loop in the page background or when an audio file is used
          as background atmo.

          ## Automatic subtitles

          The selection made by the user in the subtitles menu on
          video or audio pages is stored between pages and
          sessions.

          By default the option "Auto" is selected in the subtitles
          menu. A text track to display is then choosen automatically
          according to the following rules:


          * If a file has a text track of kind "translation" in the
            language of the story, it is displayed as subtitle
            automatically. This is meant for people who are able to
            understand the language of the story, but not the language
            spoken in the video or audio.

          * If instead the file has a text track of kind "audio
            replacement", it is displayed automatically if the volume
            has been set to mute using the controls in the navigation
            bar. Please note that for technical reasons it is not
            possible to detect if the volume has been set to mute
            outside of the browser or on mobile devices in general.

          ## Default text track

          If the automatic selection described above does not fit your
          needs, you can select a default text track for each video or
          audio page. It will be displayed if the user has not
          selected a text track from the subtitles menu.

          Open the files tab of the page and choose a default text
          track from the conext menu available via the menu button
          inside the video or audio file field.
